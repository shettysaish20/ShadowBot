Create a professional one-page (index.html) dark-themed (Black and White only) portfolio website for a Software Hacker using Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, Animate.css (for scroll-in section reveals and CTA hover transitions), and Splide.js (for a testimonial carousel and horizontally scrolling image gallery); use CDN only (no build tools); apply a sleek black/charcoal base, warm beige/muted orange accents, elegant typography, refined spacing, subtle transitions (no glows/neons); include sticky header with anchor links, hero section with fullscreen image (https://picsum.photos/1600/900?blur=1), category highlight cards (https://picsum.photos/400/600?grayscale/random=1), animated counters (clients, projects, years), About (mission, timeline), Gallery or Services grid (6–8 projects), Contact form (name/email/message), and footer with social icons; keep layout responsive and professional, with no lorem ipsum, real readable text, and pure HTML/CSS/JS; Use CoderAgent in 9–10 precise updates (meta, header, hero, counters, cards, timeline, gallery, testimonial slider, contact form, layout cleanup), and finally audit spacing, contrast, and visual balance to ensure premium Software Hacker look. Ask the CoderAgent to update the same index.html, use code to update it if file is longer and make sure old content is not deleted, and only required sections are updated. Remind CoderAgent to update the placeholders (not overwrite whole file)
