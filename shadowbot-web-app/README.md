# Shadowbot Web Site (static)

This is a lightweight, static marketing site for Shadowbot — the undetectable AI overlay for interviews and customer support.

## Customize links and video
Edit `config.js` to set:
- `videoId`: YouTube video ID for the demo
- `downloads.windows`: direct URL to the Windows installer (.exe)
- `downloads.mac`: direct URL to the macOS installer (.dmg)
- `github`: repository link (already set)

## Replace placeholders
- Screenshots in `assets/placeholders/*.svg` — replace with real images of the app
- App icon in `assets/icons/app-icon.svg` — replace with final branding as needed

## Local preview
Open `index.html` directly in your browser. No build step is required.

## Notes
- This site does NOT mention cloning or running source code. It links to installers only.
- The design includes an interactive hero, features, how-it-works, screenshots carousel, and a video embed.
