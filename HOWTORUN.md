Check:
- your .env file is there? 
- your paths are proper in all files
- you have proper ollama models installed and initialized
- you are running from this location...... S12>uv run browserMCP/browser_mcp_sse.py BEFORE
- you run .....S12>uv run main.py
- check this query: Open https://www.inkers.ai in a new tab, and click on Demo Button. Inform Decision that whenever it calls any tool, it will immediately return the broswer state, which will have id's for buttons and things it can interact with. So it will have to save them for reuse for next step. 
- Open www.inkers.ai in a new tab, and then click on contact button. Then subscribe me for updated. Use email as: rohan@test.com and Name as "Rohan". Remember, whenever we access broswer tools, we get the list of all interactable elements along with commands to use them back. So all the data will be there in the globals. 
- To run BrowserMCP in debug mode: S12>uv run mcp dev browserMCP/browser_mcp_stdio.py
- Open www.inkers.ai in browser, click "Contact" and subscribe me with Name: Rohan and email: rohan@test.com. Remind Decision that everytime we use ANY browser based tools, they return the next state of the browser. So Alwasy use return = tool_name. This return value will store the state and indexes of interactive elements and we will need them to click, or till in things.
