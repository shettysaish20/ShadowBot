I am using a dictionary to implement the DAG. Each key represents a node in the graph. And the value associated with a key represents a set of nodes dependent on the node at that key. Is it necessary to use an orderedDict instead of a Dict for implementing the DAG. The orderedDict preserves the order of insertion of the keys. I am wondering why would one want to preserve the insertion order of nodes in the DAG when the value at each key represents a set of nodes dependent of the node at that corresponding key? python directed-acyclic-graphs Share Improve this question Follow asked Feb 27, 2019 at 10:25 Sharu Gupta Sharu Gupta 201 1 1 gold badge 2 2 silver badges 5 5 bronze badges 0 Add a comment | 3 Answers 3 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Trending (recent votes count more) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 22 graphlib is the module in the Python standard library for creating directed acyclic graphics.

DAGs are used to show how things are related or depend on each other in a clear and organized way. In this article, we are going to learn about Directed Acyclic Graph , its properties, and application in real life. Directed Acyclic Graph What is Directed Acyclic Graph? A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a directed graph that does not contain any cycles. Below Graph represents a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Direct Acyclic Graph Meaning of Directed Acyclic Graph: Directed Acyclic Graph has two important features: Directed Edge s: In Directed Acyclic Graph, each edge has a direction, meaning it goes from one vertex (node) to another. This direction signifies a one-way relationship or dependency between nodes. Acyclic: The term \" acyclic \" indicates that there are no cycles or closed loops within the graph. In other words, you cannot traverse a sequence of directed edges and return to the same node, following the edge directions. Formation of cycles is prohibited in DAG. Hence this characteristic is essential. Directed Acyclic Graph Properties of Directed Acyclic Graph DAG: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) has different properties that make them usable in graph problems. There are following properties of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Reachability Relation: In DAG, we can determine if there is a reachability relation between two nodes. Node A is said to be reachable from node B if there exists a directed path that starts at node B and ends at node A. This implies that you can follow the direction of edges in the graph to get from B to A. Transitive Closure: The transitive closure of a directed graph is a new graph that represents all the direct and indirect relationships or connections between nodes in the original graph. In other words, it tells you which nodes can be reached from other nodes by following one or more directed edges. Transitive Closure of Directed Acyclic Graph Transitive Reduction: The transitive reduction of a directed graph is a new graph that retains only the essential, direct relationships between nodes, while removing any unnecessary indirect edges. In essence, it simplifies the graph by eliminating edges that', 'images': [{'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231019170926/dag6-660x478.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'dag6-660x478', 'width': '660', 'height': '478', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231019164716/Untitled-Diagram-(2).png', 'alt_text': 'Untitled-Diagram-(2)', 'width': '501', 'height': '226', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231106151300/1-(2).jpg', 'alt_text': '1-(2)', 'width': '1000', 'height': '500', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231106151411/2-(1).jpg', 'alt_text': '2-(1)', 'width': '1000', 'height': '500', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231106155309/3-(1).jpg', 'alt_text': '3-(1)', 'width': '1000', 'height': '500', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://medium.com/@dataproducts/step-by-step-process-to-building-directed-acyclic-graphs-dags-with-airflow-1bb41e352d15', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://object-oriented-python.github.io/9_trees_and_directed_acyclic_graphs.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://deepwiki.com/PacktPublishing/Causal-Inference-and-Discovery-in-Python/2.3-graphical-models-and-dags', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Introduction to MySQL RIGHT JOIN clause MySQL RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN , except that the treatment of the joined tables is reversed. Heres the syntax of the RIGHT JOIN of two tables t1 and t2 : SELECT select_list FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON join_condition; Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) In this syntax: The t1 is the left table and t2 is the right table. The join_condition specifies the rule for matching rows from both tables. If the join_condition uses the equal operator ( = ) and the joined columns of both tables have the same name, and you can use the USING syntax like this: SELECT select_list FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 USING (column_name); Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) Therefore, the following join conditions are equivalent: ON t1.column_name = t2.column_name Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) and USING (column_name); Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) How the RIGHT JOIN works. The RIGHT JOIN starts selecting data from the right table ( t2 ). It matches each row from the right table with every row from the left table. If both rows cause the join condition to evaluate to TRUE , the RIGHT JOIN combines columns of these rows into a new row and includes this new row in the result set. If a row from the right table does not have a matching row from the left table, the RIGHT JOIN combines columns of rows from the right table with NULL values for all columns of the right table into a new row and include this row in the result set. In other words, the RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table regardless of having matching rows from the left table or not. Its important to emphasize that RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN clauses are functionally equivalent, and they can replace each other as long as the table order is reversed. Notice that the RIGHT OUTER JOIN is a synonym for RIGHT JOIN . Therefore, you can use them interchangeably. MySQL RIGHT JOIN clause examples Well use the tables employees and customers from the sample database for the demonstration: The column salesRepEmployeeNumber in the table customers links to the column employeeNumber in the employees table. A sales representative, or an employee, may be in charge of zero or more customers. And each customer is taken care of by zero or one sales representative. If the value in the column salesRepEmployeeNumber is NULL, which means the customer does not have any sales representative. 1) Simple MySQL RIGHT JOIN example This statement uses the RIGHT JOIN clause join the table customers with the table employees . SELECT employeeNumber,   customerNumber FROM customers RIGHT JOIN employees ON salesRepEmployeeNumber = employeeNumber ORDER BY employeeNumber; Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) In this example: The RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the table employees whether rows in the table employees have matching values in the column salesRepEmployeeNumber of the table customers . If a row from the table employees has no matching row from the table customers , the RIGHT JOIN uses NULL for the customerNumber column. 2) Using MySQL RIGHT JOIN to find unmatching rows The following statement uses the RIGHT JOIN clause to find employees who are not in charge of any customers: SELECT employeeNumber,   customerNumber FROM customers RIGHT JOIN employees ON salesRepEmployeeNumber = employeeNumber WHERE customerNumber is NULL ORDER BY employeeNumber;', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MySQL-RIGHT-JOIN-example.png', 'alt_text': 'MySQL RIGHT JOIN example', 'width': '213', 'height': '162', 'class': 'wp-image-8164', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MySQL-RIGHT-JOIN-find-unmatching-rows.png', 'alt_text': 'MySQL RIGHT JOIN - find unmatching rows', 'width': '218', 'height': '174', 'class': 'wp-image-8165', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://hightouch.com/sql-dictionary/sql-right-join', 'content': 'SQL RIGHT JOIN - Syntax, Use Cases, and Examples | Hightouch Skip to main content Snowflake Ventures & Capital One Ventures invest in Hightouch to bring AI agents to marketers Copy .SVG Brand assets Press Platform Composable CDP Customer Studio Build audiences Reverse ETL Sync data Identity Resolution Stitch users together Hightouch Events Collect data Real-time Personalization Dynamic digital experiences Match Booster Increase ad match rates Campaign Intelligence Analyze campaigns AI Decisioning AI agents Deliver 1:1 experiences at scale Reinforcement learning Continuous optimization Insights Uncover new opportunities Enterprise-ready platform features Enterprise-level security Enterprise-level security with SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001 certification Observability Full transparency and control to monitor and troubleshoot Governance & access control Robust access control and change management Solutions By team Marketing Advertising Data Operations By industry Retail & eCommerce Media & Entertainment Financial Services Healthcare B2B SaaS For marketing Audience segmentation Journey orchestration Real-time personalization Profile enrichment Customer 360 For advertising Audience targeting Audience suppression Conversion tracking Match rate boosting Featured Learn about the benefits of a Composable CDP and how it compares to a traditional CDP solution Learn more Integrations All integrations Integration catalog Hightouch integrates with 250+ tools spanning Advertising, Marketing Automation, CRMs, Customer Success, and more See all 250+ integrations Popular sources Snowflake Databricks Google BigQuery AWS Redshift Azure Synapse See all sources Popular destinations Salesforce HubSpot Google Ads Facebook Ads Iterable See all destinations Popular extensions dbt Sigma Looker Fivetran Customers Resources Explore Blog Learn Whitepapers & guides Playbooks Lifecycle Leaders newsletter CDP Comparisons Documentation Core concepts Understand the basics of how Hightouch works Syncs Syncs define how you want to get data from your source to destination Models Hightouch models define and organize data from a source Read our docs Get started Talk to us Schedule 30-minutes to talk through how to solve your use cases Events Find conferences, local events, and webinars to learn more Solutions partners Our Partners design, build and deliver exceptional data solutions Featured The complete guide to Composable Customer Data Platforms Download the whitepaper Pricing Log in Get a demo SQL Dictionary Joins SQL RIGHT JOIN What is SQL RIGHT JOIN? SQL RIGHT JOIN, also known as a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, is a type of SQL JOIN operation that retrieves all records from the right table (table2) and the matching records from the left table (table1). If there are no matching records in the left table, NULL values are included for those columns. When you would use it You would use a SQL RIGHT JOIN when you want to retrieve all the records from one table (the right table) and only the matching records from a related table (the left table). Common use cases for RIGHT JOIN include: Displaying all items: When you want to display all items from the right table, even if there are no corresponding items in the left table. Handling missing data: When you need to handle situations where data might be missing or incomplete in one of the tables. Optional relationships: In scenarios where relationships between tables are optional, and you still want to display data from the secondary table. Combining data: When you want to combine data from multiple tables while preserving all records from one of the tables. Syntax The syntax for a SQL RIGHT JOIN operation is as follows: SELECT column_list FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column; column_list : A list of columns to retrieve from the joined tables. table1 and table2 : The names of the tables to be joined. column : The common column or key that relates the tables.

DSA to Development Course SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right and Full Join) Last Updated : 02 Aug, 2025 Comments Improve Suggest changes Like Article Like Report SQL joins are fundamental tools for combining data from multiple tables in relational databases. For example, consider two tables where one table (say Student) has student information with id as a key and other table (say Marks) has information about marks of every student id. Now to display the marks of every student with name, we need to join the two tables. Please remember, we store data into multiple tables as part of database normalization to avoid anomalies and redundancies. Types of SQL Joins Let us visualize how each join type operates: 1. SQL INNER JOIN The INNER JOIN keyword sele cts all rows from both the tables as long as the condition is satisfied. This keyword will create the result set by combining all rows from both the tables where the condition satisfies i.e value of the common field will be the same. Syntax: SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,.... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column; Note : We can also write JOIN instead of INNER JOIN. JOIN is same as INNER JOIN. Inner Join Example of INNER JOIN Consider the two tables, Student and StudentCourse, which share a common column ROLL_NO . Using SQL JOINS, we can combine data from these tables based on their relationship, allowing us to retrieve meaningful information like student details along with their enrolled courses. 1. Student Table: Student 2. StudentCourse Table: StudentCourse Let's look at the example of INNER JOIN clause, and understand it's working.

Share Tweet Pin It Share It is an important task for Linux administrators to monitor disk space usage on any system thats used for hosting critical applications, in order to prevents the system from becoming unresponsive or get into an unknown problem. There are various monitoring tools available that monitor everything, and trigger an email when the system reaches a given threshold. However, it is suitable for small and large environments, but what is the best approach if you only have a few systems? In this case, it is better to write a shell script based on what you need to monitor in your environment. We have included three shell scripts below and you can choose the one that suits your need. These scripts will trigger an email to the corresponding email id when the system reaches a given threshold. Refer to this article (embedded link), If you are looking for a bash script to monitor disk space usage on multiple remote Linux systems . Make a note: When using df -h in the shell script in some distributions, you may end up with the below error message as the output is not in the correct format. Use df -Ph (POSIX output format) to deal with this problem. # sh /opt/script/disk-usage-alert-old.sh /dev/mapper/vg_2g-lv_root test-script.sh: line 7: [: /dev/mapper/vg_2g-lv_root: integer expression expected / 9.8G Method-1: Shell script to monitor disk space usage in Linux This script is very simple and straightforward, which triggers an email when the system reaches a given threshold. In this example, we set threshold at 60% for testing purpose and you can change this limit based on your requirements. Be sure to include your email ID in the script. # vi /opt/script/disk-usage-alert.sh #!/bin/sh dusage=$(df -Ph | grep -vE \\'^tmpfs|cdrom\\' | sed s/%//g | awk \\'{ if($5 > 60) print $0;}\\') fscount=$(echo \"$dusage\" | wc -l) if [ $fscount -ge 2 ]; then echo \"$dusage\" | mail -s \"Disk Space Alert On $(hostname) at $(date)\" [emailprotected] else echo \"Disk usage is in under threshold\"  fi Set an executable permission to the file disk-usage-alert.sh : # chmod +x /opt/script/disk-usage-alert.sh Run the following script to see if it works as expected: # sh /opt/script/disk-usage-alert.sh Sampleemail alert: You will receive an email alert similar to the one below. Filesystem              Size Used Avail Use Mounted on /dev/mapper/vg_2g-lv_root       10G 6.7G 3.4G 67 / /dev/mapper/vg_2g-lv_home       5.0G 4.3G 784M 85 /home Finally add a cronjob to automate this as shown below. It will run every 10 minutes. # crontab -e */10 * * * * /bin/bash /opt/script/disk-usage-alert.sh Note: As the script is scheduled to run once every 10 minutes, you will receive an email alert every 10 minutes. For example: if your system reaches the given limit after 16 minutes, you will receive an email alert in the second cycle, i.e. after 20 minutes (2nd 10 minute cycle). Method-2: Monitoring disk space usage with shell script Alternatively, the following shell script can be used to monitor disk space usage on Linux systems. This script send multiple emails if more than one file system reaches the given threshold limit, as the script is uses a loop (notice the do logic below): # vi /opt/script/disk-usage-alert-1.sh #!/bin/sh df -Ph | grep -vE \\'^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom\\' | awk \\'{ print $5,$1 }\\' | while read output; do  echo $output  used=$(echo $output | awk \\'{print $1}\\' | se', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.2daygeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/how-to-create-users-using-shell-script-in-linux-348x215.png', 'alt_text': 'How to Create Users using Shell Script in Linux', 'width': '348', 'height': '215', 'class': 'attachment-hitmag-grid size-hitmag-grid wp-post-image', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.2daygeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/map-san-lun-physical-disk-filesystem-lvm-info-linux-348x215.png', 'alt_text': 'Mapping SAN LUN, Disk, LVM and FS in Linux', 'width': '348', 'height': '215', 'class': 'attachment-hitmag-grid size-hitmag-grid wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.consolebear.com/2024/07/09/receive-disk-space-alerts-with-a-simple-bash-script/', 'content': 'Bash Script for Real-Time Disk Space Alerts Sent to Your Inbox | Console Bear Home Dev DevOps SysOps CyberSec Tips and Tricks Contact Select Page Bash Script for Real-Time Disk Space Alerts Sent to Your Inbox by Console Bear | Jul 9, 2024 | All , DevOps , Linux , SysOps , Tips and Tricks | 0 comments Running out of disk space can cause significant issues, including system crashes and data loss. This Bash script monitors the disk space usage of a specified directory and sends an email alert if the usage exceeds a defined threshold. Step-by-Step Guide : 1. Define Variables : Set the threshold percentage for disk usage and the email address to receive alerts. THRESHOLD=80 EMAIL= \"your_email@example.com\" 2. Check Disk Usage : Use the df command to get the disk usage of the specified directory. DISK_USAGE=$( df /path/to/directory | grep / | awk \\'{ print $5 }\\' | sed \\'s/%//g\\' ) 3. Send an Email Alert : If the disk usage exceeds the threshold, send an email alert. if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then echo \"Disk space warning: $DISK_USAGE % used\" | mail -s \"Disk Space Alert\" $EMAIL fi Complete Script : #!/bin/bash # Variables THRESHOLD=80 EMAIL= your_email@example.com DISK_USAGE=$( df /path/to/directory | grep / | awk { print $5 } | sed s/%//g ) # Check disk usage if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then echo Disk space warning: $DISK_USAGE % used | mail -s Disk Space Alert $EMAIL fi Usage : Replace /path/to/directory with the directory to monitor. Set THRESHOLD to the desired percentage. Replace your_email@example.com with your email address. Save it to .sh file (ie. diskspacealert.sh) and run it periodically with a crontab This script ensures you are promptly notified if your disk space is running low, allowing you to take action before it becomes a critical issue.

If the disk becomes full, it can cause issues such as system crashes, data loss, and other problems. To prevent these issues, you can use a shell script to monitor the disk space and send an alert when the available space falls below a certain threshold. In this article, we will walk through the process of creating a shell script that monitors the disk space and sends an alert when the available space falls below a certain threshold. We will use the df command to check the available disk space and the mail command to send the alert. The features of this script are: This script can check available free space for multiple disks You can enable to send an email notification You can set the threshold values for Warning and Critical conditions Accept inputs as command line parameters Step 1: Shell Script to Check Disk Space I have written this shell script that is capable of checking for the available free space on given disks and notifying the admin if the disk space is low. This script required a Bash shell to run. First copy the shell script on your Linux system. In the next steps, I will provide instructions on how to execute it. Download this script from GitHub: https://github.com/tecrahul/shell-scripts/blob/master/check-disk-space/check_disk_space.sh Otherwise copy the below shell script and paste it to a file on your server. #/usr/bin/env bash ######################################################################### ######################################################################### # # This shell script checks for free disk space for defined disks and send # email alert based on threshold defined for warning and critical emails # # Warning and critical thresholds can be passed as command-line parameters # The command can be run as: # # \"bash /path/to/script.sh -w 20 -c 10 -d /dev/sda1 -d /\" # # The above script will check free space on /dev/sda1 and disk # mounted on the root (/) file system.

DAGs are widely used to model dependencies and workflows, making them essential in various domains, including data science, data engineering, and task scheduling. Popular projects like Apache Airflow and Apache Spark heavily rely on DAGs to manage complex data pipelines and task orchestrations. <i>DAGs provide a structured and intuitive way to represent relationships and dependencies between tasks or processes.</i></p><img src='https://i.sstatic.net/qaIWj.png' alt='example DAG' style='max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;'><p>The fundamental concept behind a DAG is that tasks or nodes are connected by directed edges, indicating the order in which they must be executed. For instance, if task B depends on task A, task A must complete successfully before task B can start. The 'acyclic' property ensures that there are no circular dependencies, preventing infinite loops and guaranteeing a clear and deterministic execution path. DAGs are particularly useful in scenarios where the order of operations is critical for achieving the desired outcome. <a href='https://www.mungingdata.com/python/dag-directed-acyclic-graph-networkx/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[1]</a></p><p><b>Applications of DAGs:</b></p><ul><li><b>Data Pipelines:</b> DAGs are used to define and manage complex data transformation pipelines, ensuring data flows correctly from source to destination.</li><li><b>Task Scheduling:</b> DAGs help schedule tasks in a way that respects dependencies, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing execution time.</li><li><b>Dependency Resolution:</b> DAGs are used to resolve dependencies in software projects, ensuring that libraries and modules are loaded in the correct order.</li><li><b>Causal Inference:</b> DAGs are applied in causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships between variables.</li></ul><h3>Python Code Example:</h3><p>This example demonstrates how to create and manipulate a DAG using the <code>graphlib</code> module in Python.

I am using a dictionary to implement the DAG. Each key represents a node in the graph. And the value associated with a key represents a set of nodes dependent on the node at that key. Is it necessary to use an orderedDict instead of a Dict for implementing the DAG. The orderedDict preserves the order of insertion of the keys. I am wondering why would one want to preserve the insertion order of nodes in the DAG when the value at each key represents a set of nodes dependent of the node at that corresponding key? python directed-acyclic-graphs Share Improve this question Follow asked Feb 27, 2019 at 10:25 Sharu Gupta Sharu Gupta 201 1 1 gold badge 2 2 silver badges 5 5 bronze badges 0 Add a comment | 3 Answers 3 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Trending (recent votes count more) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 22 graphlib is the module in the Python standard library for creating directed acyclic graphics.

DAGs are used to show how things are related or depend on each other in a clear and organized way. In this article, we are going to learn about Directed Acyclic Graph , its properties, and application in real life. Directed Acyclic Graph What is Directed Acyclic Graph? A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a directed graph that does not contain any cycles. Below Graph represents a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Direct Acyclic Graph Meaning of Directed Acyclic Graph: Directed Acyclic Graph has two important features: Directed Edge s: In Directed Acyclic Graph, each edge has a direction, meaning it goes from one vertex (node) to another. This direction signifies a one-way relationship or dependency between nodes. Acyclic: The term \" acyclic \" indicates that there are no cycles or closed loops within the graph. In other words, you cannot traverse a sequence of directed edges and return to the same node, following the edge directions. Formation of cycles is prohibited in DAG. Hence this characteristic is essential. Directed Acyclic Graph Properties of Directed Acyclic Graph DAG: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) has different properties that make them usable in graph problems. There are following properties of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Reachability Relation: In DAG, we can determine if there is a reachability relation between two nodes. Node A is said to be reachable from node B if there exists a directed path that starts at node B and ends at node A. This implies that you can follow the direction of edges in the graph to get from B to A. Transitive Closure: The transitive closure of a directed graph is a new graph that represents all the direct and indirect relationships or connections between nodes in the original graph. In other words, it tells you which nodes can be reached from other nodes by following one or more directed edges. Transitive Closure of Directed Acyclic Graph Transitive Reduction: The transitive reduction of a directed graph is a new graph that retains only the essential, direct relationships between nodes, while removing any unnecessary indirect edges. In essence, it simplifies the graph by eliminating edges that', 'images': [{'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231019170926/dag6-660x478.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'dag6-660x478', 'width': '660', 'height': '478', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231019164716/Untitled-Diagram-(2).png', 'alt_text': 'Untitled-Diagram-(2)', 'width': '501', 'height': '226', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231106151300/1-(2).jpg', 'alt_text': '1-(2)', 'width': '1000', 'height': '500', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231106151411/2-(1).jpg', 'alt_text': '2-(1)', 'width': '1000', 'height': '500', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231106155309/3-(1).jpg', 'alt_text': '3-(1)', 'width': '1000', 'height': '500', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://medium.com/@dataproducts/step-by-step-process-to-building-directed-acyclic-graphs-dags-with-airflow-1bb41e352d15', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://object-oriented-python.github.io/9_trees_and_directed_acyclic_graphs.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://deepwiki.com/PacktPublishing/Causal-Inference-and-Discovery-in-Python/2.3-graphical-models-and-dags', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

Introduction to MySQL RIGHT JOIN clause MySQL RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN , except that the treatment of the joined tables is reversed. Heres the syntax of the RIGHT JOIN of two tables t1 and t2 : SELECT select_list FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON join_condition; Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) In this syntax: The t1 is the left table and t2 is the right table. The join_condition specifies the rule for matching rows from both tables. If the join_condition uses the equal operator ( = ) and the joined columns of both tables have the same name, and you can use the USING syntax like this: SELECT select_list FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 USING (column_name); Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) Therefore, the following join conditions are equivalent: ON t1.column_name = t2.column_name Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) and USING (column_name); Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) How the RIGHT JOIN works. The RIGHT JOIN starts selecting data from the right table ( t2 ). It matches each row from the right table with every row from the left table. If both rows cause the join condition to evaluate to TRUE , the RIGHT JOIN combines columns of these rows into a new row and includes this new row in the result set. If a row from the right table does not have a matching row from the left table, the RIGHT JOIN combines columns of rows from the right table with NULL values for all columns of the right table into a new row and include this row in the result set. In other words, the RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table regardless of having matching rows from the left table or not. Its important to emphasize that RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN clauses are functionally equivalent, and they can replace each other as long as the table order is reversed. Notice that the RIGHT OUTER JOIN is a synonym for RIGHT JOIN . Therefore, you can use them interchangeably. MySQL RIGHT JOIN clause examples Well use the tables employees and customers from the sample database for the demonstration: The column salesRepEmployeeNumber in the table customers links to the column employeeNumber in the employees table. A sales representative, or an employee, may be in charge of zero or more customers. And each customer is taken care of by zero or one sales representative. If the value in the column salesRepEmployeeNumber is NULL, which means the customer does not have any sales representative. 1) Simple MySQL RIGHT JOIN example This statement uses the RIGHT JOIN clause join the table customers with the table employees . SELECT employeeNumber,   customerNumber FROM customers RIGHT JOIN employees ON salesRepEmployeeNumber = employeeNumber ORDER BY employeeNumber; Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) ( sql ) In this example: The RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the table employees whether rows in the table employees have matching values in the column salesRepEmployeeNumber of the table customers . If a row from the table employees has no matching row from the table customers , the RIGHT JOIN uses NULL for the customerNumber column. 2) Using MySQL RIGHT JOIN to find unmatching rows The following statement uses the RIGHT JOIN clause to find employees who are not in charge of any customers: SELECT employeeNumber,   customerNumber FROM customers RIGHT JOIN employees ON salesRepEmployeeNumber = employeeNumber WHERE customerNumber is NULL ORDER BY employeeNumber;', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MySQL-RIGHT-JOIN-example.png', 'alt_text': 'MySQL RIGHT JOIN example', 'width': '213', 'height': '162', 'class': 'wp-image-8164', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MySQL-RIGHT-JOIN-find-unmatching-rows.png', 'alt_text': 'MySQL RIGHT JOIN - find unmatching rows', 'width': '218', 'height': '174', 'class': 'wp-image-8165', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://hightouch.com/sql-dictionary/sql-right-join', 'content': 'SQL RIGHT JOIN - Syntax, Use Cases, and Examples | Hightouch Skip to main content Snowflake Ventures & Capital One Ventures invest in Hightouch to bring AI agents to marketers Copy .SVG Brand assets Press Platform Composable CDP Customer Studio Build audiences Reverse ETL Sync data Identity Resolution Stitch users together Hightouch Events Collect data Real-time Personalization Dynamic digital experiences Match Booster Increase ad match rates Campaign Intelligence Analyze campaigns AI Decisioning AI agents Deliver 1:1 experiences at scale Reinforcement learning Continuous optimization Insights Uncover new opportunities Enterprise-ready platform features Enterprise-level security Enterprise-level security with SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001 certification Observability Full transparency and control to monitor and troubleshoot Governance & access control Robust access control and change management Solutions By team Marketing Advertising Data Operations By industry Retail & eCommerce Media & Entertainment Financial Services Healthcare B2B SaaS For marketing Audience segmentation Journey orchestration Real-time personalization Profile enrichment Customer 360 For advertising Audience targeting Audience suppression Conversion tracking Match rate boosting Featured Learn about the benefits of a Composable CDP and how it compares to a traditional CDP solution Learn more Integrations All integrations Integration catalog Hightouch integrates with 250+ tools spanning Advertising, Marketing Automation, CRMs, Customer Success, and more See all 250+ integrations Popular sources Snowflake Databricks Google BigQuery AWS Redshift Azure Synapse See all sources Popular destinations Salesforce HubSpot Google Ads Facebook Ads Iterable See all destinations Popular extensions dbt Sigma Looker Fivetran Customers Resources Explore Blog Learn Whitepapers & guides Playbooks Lifecycle Leaders newsletter CDP Comparisons Documentation Core concepts Understand the basics of how Hightouch works Syncs Syncs define how you want to get data from your source to destination Models Hightouch models define and organize data from a source Read our docs Get started Talk to us Schedule 30-minutes to talk through how to solve your use cases Events Find conferences, local events, and webinars to learn more Solutions partners Our Partners design, build and deliver exceptional data solutions Featured The complete guide to Composable Customer Data Platforms Download the whitepaper Pricing Log in Get a demo SQL Dictionary Joins SQL RIGHT JOIN What is SQL RIGHT JOIN? SQL RIGHT JOIN, also known as a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, is a type of SQL JOIN operation that retrieves all records from the right table (table2) and the matching records from the left table (table1). If there are no matching records in the left table, NULL values are included for those columns. When you would use it You would use a SQL RIGHT JOIN when you want to retrieve all the records from one table (the right table) and only the matching records from a related table (the left table). Common use cases for RIGHT JOIN include: Displaying all items: When you want to display all items from the right table, even if there are no corresponding items in the left table. Handling missing data: When you need to handle situations where data might be missing or incomplete in one of the tables. Optional relationships: In scenarios where relationships between tables are optional, and you still want to display data from the secondary table. Combining data: When you want to combine data from multiple tables while preserving all records from one of the tables. Syntax The syntax for a SQL RIGHT JOIN operation is as follows: SELECT column_list FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column; column_list : A list of columns to retrieve from the joined tables. table1 and table2 : The names of the tables to be joined. column : The common column or key that relates the tables.

Now to display the marks of every student with name, we need to join the two tables. Please remember, we store data into multiple tables as part of database normalization to avoid anomalies and redundancies. Types of SQL Joins Let us visualize how each join type operates: 1. SQL INNER JOIN The INNER JOIN keyword sele cts all rows from both the tables as long as the condition is satisfied. This keyword will create the result set by combining all rows from both the tables where the condition satisfies i.e value of the common field will be the same. Syntax: SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,.... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column; Note : We can also write JOIN instead of INNER JOIN. JOIN is same as INNER JOIN. Inner Join Example of INNER JOIN Consider the two tables, Student and StudentCourse, which share a common column ROLL_NO . Using SQL JOINS, we can combine data from these tables based on their relationship, allowing us to retrieve meaningful information like student details along with their enrolled courses. 1. Student Table: Student 2. StudentCourse Table: StudentCourse Let's look at the example of INNER JOIN clause, and understand it's working. This query will show the names and age of students enrolled in different courses. Query: SELECT StudentCourse.COURSE_ID, Student.NAME, Student.AGE FROM Student INNER JOIN StudentCourse ON Student.ROLL_NO = StudentCourse.ROLL_NO; O\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250607125936039070/Student_table.webp', 'alt_text': 'Student_table', 'width': '640', 'height': '318', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250607130103043174/StudentCourse_Table.webp', 'alt_text': 'StudentCourse_Table', 'width': '361', 'height': '310', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250607130329956913/Example_innerjoin.webp', 'alt_text': 'Example_innerjoin', 'width': '546', 'height': '208', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250607130804622355/example_rightjoin.webp', 'alt_text': 'example_rightjoin', 'width': '361', 'height': '316', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250607125822884856/SQL-Join.webp', 'alt_text': 'SQL-Join', 'width': '502', 'height': '329', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.slingacademy.com/article/postgresql-using-right-join-to-join-multiple-tables/', 'content': \"PostgreSQL: Using RIGHT JOIN to join multiple tables -

Share Tweet Pin It Share It is an important task for Linux administrators to monitor disk space usage on any system thats used for hosting critical applications, in order to prevents the system from becoming unresponsive or get into an unknown problem. There are various monitoring tools available that monitor everything, and trigger an email when the system reaches a given threshold. However, it is suitable for small and large environments, but what is the best approach if you only have a few systems? In this case, it is better to write a shell script based on what you need to monitor in your environment. We have included three shell scripts below and you can choose the one that suits your need. These scripts will trigger an email to the corresponding email id when the system reaches a given threshold. Refer to this article (embedded link), If you are looking for a bash script to monitor disk space usage on multiple remote Linux systems . Make a note: When using df -h in the shell script in some distributions, you may end up with the below error message as the output is not in the correct format. Use df -Ph (POSIX output format) to deal with this problem. # sh /opt/script/disk-usage-alert-old.sh /dev/mapper/vg_2g-lv_root test-script.sh: line 7: [: /dev/mapper/vg_2g-lv_root: integer expression expected / 9.8G Method-1: Shell script to monitor disk space usage in Linux This script is very simple and straightforward, which triggers an email when the system reaches a given threshold. In this example, we set threshold at 60% for testing purpose and you can change this limit based on your requirements. Be sure to include your email ID in the script. # vi /opt/script/disk-usage-alert.sh #!/bin/sh dusage=$(df -Ph | grep -vE \\'^tmpfs|cdrom\\' | sed s/%//g | awk \\'{ if($5 > 60) print $0;}\\') fscount=$(echo \"$dusage\" | wc -l) if [ $fscount -ge 2 ]; then echo \"$dusage\" | mail -s \"Disk Space Alert On $(hostname) at $(date)\" [emailprotected] else echo \"Disk usage is in under threshold\"  fi Set an executable permission to the file disk-usage-alert.sh : # chmod +x /opt/script/disk-usage-alert.sh Run the following script to see if it works as expected: # sh /opt/script/disk-usage-alert.sh Sampleemail alert: You will receive an email alert similar to the one below. Filesystem              Size Used Avail Use Mounted on /dev/mapper/vg_2g-lv_root       10G 6.7G 3.4G 67 / /dev/mapper/vg_2g-lv_home       5.0G 4.3G 784M 85 /home Finally add a cronjob to automate this as shown below. It will run every 10 minutes. # crontab -e */10 * * * * /bin/bash /opt/script/disk-usage-alert.sh Note: As the script is scheduled to run once every 10 minutes, you will receive an email alert every 10 minutes. For example: if your system reaches the given limit after 16 minutes, you will receive an email alert in the second cycle, i.e. after 20 minutes (2nd 10 minute cycle). Method-2: Monitoring disk space usage with shell script Alternatively, the following shell script can be used to monitor disk space usage on Linux systems. This script send multiple emails if more than one file system reaches the given threshold limit, as the script is uses a loop (notice the do logic below): # vi /opt/script/disk-usage-alert-1.sh #!/bin/sh df -Ph | grep -vE \\'^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom\\' | awk \\'{ print $5,$1 }\\' | while read output; do  echo $output  used=$(echo $output | awk \\'{print $1}\\' | se', 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.2daygeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/how-to-create-users-using-shell-script-in-linux-348x215.png', 'alt_text': 'How to Create Users using Shell Script in Linux', 'width': '348', 'height': '215', 'class': 'attachment-hitmag-grid size-hitmag-grid wp-post-image', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.2daygeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/map-san-lun-physical-disk-filesystem-lvm-info-linux-348x215.png', 'alt_text': 'Mapping SAN LUN, Disk, LVM and FS in Linux', 'width': '348', 'height': '215', 'class': 'attachment-hitmag-grid size-hitmag-grid wp-post-image', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.consolebear.com/2024/07/09/receive-disk-space-alerts-with-a-simple-bash-script/', 'content': 'Bash Script for Real-Time Disk Space Alerts Sent to Your Inbox | Console Bear Home Dev DevOps SysOps CyberSec Tips and Tricks Contact Select Page Bash Script for Real-Time Disk Space Alerts Sent to Your Inbox by Console Bear | Jul 9, 2024 | All , DevOps , Linux , SysOps , Tips and Tricks | 0 comments Running out of disk space can cause significant issues, including system crashes and data loss. This Bash script monitors the disk space usage of a specified directory and sends an email alert if the usage exceeds a defined threshold. Step-by-Step Guide : 1. Define Variables : Set the threshold percentage for disk usage and the email address to receive alerts. THRESHOLD=80 EMAIL= \"your_email@example.com\" 2. Check Disk Usage : Use the df command to get the disk usage of the specified directory. DISK_USAGE=$( df /path/to/directory | grep / | awk \\'{ print $5 }\\' | sed \\'s/%//g\\' ) 3. Send an Email Alert : If the disk usage exceeds the threshold, send an email alert. if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then echo \"Disk space warning: $DISK_USAGE % used\" | mail -s \"Disk Space Alert\" $EMAIL fi Complete Script : #!/bin/bash # Variables THRESHOLD=80 EMAIL= your_email@example.com DISK_USAGE=$( df /path/to/directory | grep / | awk { print $5 } | sed s/%//g ) # Check disk usage if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then echo Disk space warning: $DISK_USAGE % used | mail -s Disk Space Alert $EMAIL fi Usage : Replace /path/to/directory with the directory to monitor. Set THRESHOLD to the desired percentage. Replace your_email@example.com with your email address. Save it to .sh file (ie. diskspacealert.sh) and run it periodically with a crontab This script ensures you are promptly notified if your disk space is running low, allowing you to take action before it becomes a critical issue.

If the disk becomes full, it can cause issues such as system crashes, data loss, and other problems. To prevent these issues, you can use a shell script to monitor the disk space and send an alert when the available space falls below a certain threshold. In this article, we will walk through the process of creating a shell script that monitors the disk space and sends an alert when the available space falls below a certain threshold. We will use the df command to check the available disk space and the mail command to send the alert. The features of this script are: This script can check available free space for multiple disks You can enable to send an email notification You can set the threshold values for Warning and Critical conditions Accept inputs as command line parameters Step 1: Shell Script to Check Disk Space I have written this shell script that is capable of checking for the available free space on given disks and notifying the admin if the disk space is low.

Each section delivers a detailed exploration of the core concepts, supported by hands-on code examples to illustrate effective implementation. This document is designed to provide actionable insights for developers, data engineers, and system administrators seeking to enhance their capabilities in these areas.</p></div><div id='dags'><h2 id='dags-title'>🔗 Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Python</h2><p>A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graph consisting of vertices and directed edges, with no cycles. DAGs are widely used to model dependencies and workflows, making them essential in various domains, including data science, data engineering, and task scheduling. Popular projects like Apache Airflow and Apache Spark heavily rely on DAGs to manage complex data pipelines and task orchestrations. <i>DAGs provide a structured and intuitive way to represent relationships and dependencies between tasks or processes.</i></p><img src='https://i.sstatic.net/qaIWj.png' alt='example DAG' style='max-width: 400px; margin: 10px 0;'><p>The fundamental concept behind a DAG is that tasks or nodes are connected by directed edges, indicating the order in which they must be executed. For instance, if task B depends on task A, task A must complete successfully before task B can start. The 'acyclic' property ensures that there are no circular dependencies, preventing infinite loops and guaranteeing a clear and deterministic execution path. DAGs are particularly useful in scenarios where the order of operations is critical for achieving the desired outcome. <a href='https://www.mungingdata.com/python/dag-directed-acyclic-graph-networkx/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[1]</a></p><p><b>Applications of DAGs:</b></p><ul><li><b>Data Pipelines:</b> DAGs are used to define and manage complex data transformation pipelines, ensuring data flows correctly from source to destination.</li><li><b>Task Scheduling:</b> DAGs help schedule tasks in a way that respects dependencies, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing execution time.</li><li><b>Dependency Resolution:</b> DAGs are used to resolve dependencies in software projects, ensuring that libraries and modules are loaded in the correct order.</li><li><b>Causal Inference:</b> DAGs are applied in causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships between variables.</li></ul><h3>Python Code Example:</h3><p>This example demonstrates how to create and manipulate a DAG using the <code>graphlib</code> module in Python.
